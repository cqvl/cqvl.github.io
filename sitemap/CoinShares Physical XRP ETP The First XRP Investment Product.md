## Key Features of the XRP ETP  

### 100% Physical Backing for Security  

Unlike synthetic or futures-based products, the CoinShares Physical XRP ETP is fully collateralized by XRP reserves. Each unit of the ETP corresponds directly to an equivalent amount of XRP stored in institutional-grade custody with **Komainu**, a trusted digital asset custodian. This structure eliminates counterparty risk and ensures that investors maintain direct exposure to XRP's price movements.  

### Transparency Through Blockchain Verification  

Transparency is a cornerstone of the CoinShares Physical ETP framework. The underlying XRP reserves are verified using **LedgerLens**, a blockchain analytics tool that provides real-time proof-of-reserves. Investors can independently confirm the existence and integrity of the collateralized assets, fostering trust in the product's operational framework.
