- **Supported Cryptocurrencies**: Verify that the specific cryptocurrency (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum) is supported by Robinhood's wallet.
- **Network Compatibility**: Ensure both platforms use the same blockchain network (e.g., Ethereum ERC-20) to avoid irreversible losses.

## Understanding Transfer Fees and Timeframes

Crypto transfers incur **network fees** (gas fees) determined by blockchain congestion. Key considerations:

| Platform       | Average Network Fee | Transfer Speed       |
|----------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Coinbase       | $0.50â€“$2.00*        | 10â€“30 minutes        |
| Robinhood      | Free (inbound)      | 1â€“24 hours           |
| *Varies by blockchain and network demand* |

Robinhood may take longer to credit funds due to internal verification processes. Always allow 24 hours for completion before contacting support.
