Crypto markets are decentralized, but trading activity clusters around three major time zones:  
1. **Asian Session (UTC+8â€“UTC+11)**: Focused on Japanese, Korean, and Australian markets.  
2. **European Session (UTC+1â€“UTC+3)**: High liquidity from London, Frankfurt, and Moscow.  
3. **North American Session (UTC-5â€“UTC-8)**: Dominated by U.S. and Canadian traders.  

**Key Insight**: Overlaps between sessions (e.g., European and North American overlap from 13:00â€“17:00 UTC) often see **increased trading volume** and price swings, ideal for day traders.
