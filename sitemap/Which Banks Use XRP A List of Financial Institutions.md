|--------------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|  
| Transaction Time         | 3â€“5 business days     | 4â€“7 seconds            |  
| Average Cost             | $25â€“$50               | $0.0001                |  
| Liquidity Requirements   | Pre-funded nostro accounts | Real-time settlement |

## How Banks Use XRP for Cross-Border Transactions  

### Rippleâ€™s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) Explained  

ODL eliminates pre-funded nostro accounts by using XRP as a bridge currency. Banks convert fiat to XRP, transfer it instantly, and convert it back to the recipientâ€™s local currency. This process:

- **Minimizes FX risk** through near-instant settlement.  
- **Cuts transaction fees** to fractions of a cent.  

### Case Study: SCBâ€™s XRP Pilot  

Siam Commercial Bank reduced remittance costs by 60% using ODL, enabling faster transfers for Thai workers abroad. This pilot demonstrated XRPâ€™s scalability in high-demand corridors.  

## Benefits of XRP in Banking Transactions  

### Instant Settlements and Liquidity Optimization  

XRPâ€™s 4-second settlement time contrasts sharply with SWIFTâ€™s multi-day delays. Banks can redeploy capital previously stuck in nostro accounts, improving operational efficiency.  

### Lower Transaction Costs  

With fees averaging $0.0001, XRP reduces costs for high-frequency transactions, making it ideal for micropayments and remittances.  

### Enhanced Transparency and Security
