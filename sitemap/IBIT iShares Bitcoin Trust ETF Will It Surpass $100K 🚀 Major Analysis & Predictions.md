## Conclusion: The Path to $100K  
IBIT's $100K milestone hinges on three catalysts:  
1. Bitcoin breaking $140,000 by mid-2025  
2. 10+ new countries approving crypto ETFs  
3. BlackRock launching Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHI) in Q4 2024  

While the bull case scenario remains plausible, investors must prepare for 40% drawdowns during accumulation phases. For those seeking alternative entry points, platforms like **OKX** offer direct BTC exposure with advanced derivatives.
