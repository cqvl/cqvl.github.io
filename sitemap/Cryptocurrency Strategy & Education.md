- **Bitcoin (BTC)**: The pioneering cryptocurrency and primary store of value  
- **Ethereum (ETH)**: A smart contract platform enabling decentralized applications (dApps)  
- **Binance Coin (BNB)**: Powering transactions on the Binance ecosystem  
- **Cardano (ADA)**: Focused on sustainability and scalability  
- **Solana (SOL)**: High-performance blockchain for decentralized finance (DeFi)

## Strategic Investment Approaches  

### Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA)  
This beginner-friendly strategy involves investing fixed amounts at regular intervals, reducing market volatility risks. For example, investing $100 monthly in Bitcoin over 12 months mitigates short-term price fluctuations while building long-term positions.

- **Relative Strength Index (RSI)**: Detect overbought/oversold conditions  
- **Volume Analysis**: Confirm trend strength through trading activity  

### Portfolio Diversification  
Effective crypto portfolios balance high-risk/high-reward assets with stable holdings:  
1. **Core Holdings (60-70%)**: Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other established coins  
2. **Growth Assets (20-30%)**: Mid-cap cryptocurrencies with strong fundamentals  
3. **Experimental Investments (10-15%)**: New projects and niche tokens
