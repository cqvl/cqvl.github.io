## Case Study 1: From Speculation to Strategic Investing  

###孙天’s Journey: Prioritizing Community-Driven Projects  

With four years of experience in cryptocurrency trading, 孙天 has transitioned from speculative investments to focusing on community-driven projects like MEME tokens within the DeFi ecosystem.  

**Key Insights:**  
- **Avoiding Dogecoin’s Volatility:** Despite Dogecoin’s 260x surge in 2021, 孙天 recognized its lack of sustainable value proposition.
